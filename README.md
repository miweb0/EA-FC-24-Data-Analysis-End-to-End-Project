## Introduction

Football (soccer) has been a lifelong passion of mine. Since childhood, I've been deeply engaged in the sport, not just as a fan but also as a keen learner of its tactical nuances. This project represents the fusion of that passion with my growing interest in data analysis. Using a database that I grew up with, I aimed to apply modern data analytics techniques that could be adapted for use in real-world football scouting. My goal is to one day work as a Data Analyst in a football scouting team.

In this project, I conducted an end-to-end analysis of football player data from FIFA 15 to EA FC 24. The aim was to scrub the data, perform exploratory data analysis, develop predictive models, and interpret the findings. These insights can help both FIFA gamers and professional scouts make informed decisions when selecting players based on attributes like price, quality, and potential.

## Project Outline

1. **Data Scrubbing**
   - Cleaning and preparing the dataset to ensure accuracy and reliability.
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Exploring the data to uncover key trends, patterns, and relationships.

3. **Modelling**
   - Building predictive models to identify players with high potential and value.

4. **Interpretation**
   - Analyzing the model results and deriving actionable insights for player scouting and selection.

5. **Tableau Dashboard**
   - Creating interactive visualizations to further explore the data and share insights.

6. **Conclusion**
   - Summarizing the findings and reflecting on the skills gained through the project.

## Conclusion

This project has been an exciting journey where I was able to blend my newfound interest in data analysis with my deep-rooted passion for football. By working with a dataset spanning FIFA 15 to EA FC 24, I was able to scrub, explore, model, and interpret player data in a way that applies to in-game decision-making and real-world scouting.

Throughout this project, I have:

- **Scrubbed the data**: Ensured the dataset was clean and reliable for analysis.
- **Explored the data**: Conducted exploratory data analysis to find key insights and patterns.
- **Modelled the data**: Built predictive models to identify players with high potential and value.
- **Interpreted the results**: Drew actionable conclusions that could benefit both FIFA gamers and professional scouts.

This project has deepened my understanding of how data can be leveraged to make informed decisions in football, and I am eager to apply these techniques in real-world scenarios. As I continue to develop my skills, I look forward to contributing to the dynamic field of football analytics and working toward my goal of becoming a data analyst in a football scouting team.
